# Mahindra-First-Choice-Services-MFCS-
Mahindra First Choice Services (MFCS), a multibrand car workshop aims to establish countrywide network of over 400 workshops by March 2018. Mahindra has a dataset consisting of three aspects viz. Customer data, Invoice data and Material Inventory. Objective of this project is to identify the ownership pattern of cars throughout the country in order to carry out marketing campaigns and understand their spending patterns so that services could be suited to the particular spending pattern. Second objective is to identify the type of order each state receives so that MFCS would be prepared to tackle various seasonal cases. Third objective is to predict the revenue that can be extracted from customer segments over a life of the car.
